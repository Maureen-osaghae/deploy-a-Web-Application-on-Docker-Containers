# ‚òÅÔ∏è Migrate a Web Application to Docker Containers

## üß≠ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the migration of a web application from Amazon EC2 instances (running on guest OS) to Docker containers.  
The migration included containerizing both the **Node.js web application** and the **MySQL database**, and publishing the Docker images to **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**.

### üîç Objectives
- Create a `Dockerfile` and build Docker images.
- Run and manage containers from Docker images.
- Configure container networking and environment variables.
- Migrate MySQL database into a container.
- Push Docker images to **Amazon ECR** for scalable deployment.

## üè¢ Business Scenario

The caf√© owners have expanded their business by acquiring a coffee supplier that maintains an inventory tracking web app hosted on AWS EC2.  
My role was to **migrate this legacy web application into containers** to enable better scalability, portability, and simplified DevOps management.

## üß± Architecture Overview

### Before Migration
The app and MySQL database were hosted on separate EC2 instances.

### After Migration
Both the app and database now run in Docker containers and are registered in Amazon ECR for future deployments.

## üß∞ Key Implementation Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up the Development Environment
- Connected to AWS Cloud9 / VS Code IDE for the lab setup.  
- Downloaded and extracted the project files.
- Upgraded AWS CLI and Python packages for Docker integration.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Analyzing Existing Infrastructure
- Reviewed the coffee supplier‚Äôs EC2-based app and verified database connectivity.
- Inspected running EC2 instances (`AppServerNode`, `MysqlServerNode`, and IDE instance).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Migrating the Node.js Application to Docker
- Built a Docker image using a custom `Dockerfile`.
- Ran the container exposing port `3000`.
- Configured environment variables for DB connectivity.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Migrating MySQL Database to Docker
- Created a `mysqldump` of the existing database.
- Built and ran a new MySQL container using that dump file.
- Configured network and credentials for app-to-db communication.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Pushing Docker Images to Amazon ECR
- Created an ECR repository named `node-app`.
- Tagged and pushed the Docker images.
- Verified image upload in the AWS ECR console.
